# UX Thinking
## Displaying Outputs
We want each xform to display its output so that there is
visual feedback on what it's doing.

The simplest way is to attach a textured image to the xform's on screen box
We should probably make it displayable or not

We should be able to make these bigger so we can inspect detail

## Displaying Configuration
We need to be able to display and edit configuration. Ideally while viewing 
the effect on the image.
